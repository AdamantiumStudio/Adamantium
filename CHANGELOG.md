# Changelog

Notable changes to the Adamantium Engine packages, in the form of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
All packages share one version.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `Win32Interop.LoadImage` and `GetModuleHandle`, with `LoadImageType` and `LoadImageFlags`: an icon loaded from a
  module's resources, such as the application's own.
- `Win32Interop.EnumDisplayMonitors`, `GetMonitorInfo` and `GetWindowPlacement`, with `MONITORINFOEX`,
  `WINDOWPLACEMENT` and `MonitorEnumProc`: the monitors and their work areas, and a window's restored rectangle.
- `TextShaper.Shape` in `Adamantium.Fonts.Shaping`: text to positioned glyphs with the font's OpenType substitutions and
  positioning applied the way HarfBuzz applies them - lookups of every enabled feature in the font's order, lookup
  flags and mark filtering sets, ligatures across marks, mark attachment to bases, ligatures and other marks, cursive
  attachment, contextual and chained rules of every format. Features are set per range of text (`FontFeature`,
  parsed from `liga=0`, `ss01`, `kern[3:5]=0`), the script and language pick the font's language system, combining
  marks are reordered and composed when the font has the precomposed glyph, and each glyph keeps the UTF-16 offset of
  the text it came from.
- `TextLayout.GetCaretStops` and `CaretStop`: the caret position before each character and after the last, with the
  character's width; the characters of one glyph, such as a ligature, share its width. `GlyphWordData` carries its
  `PenX`, `Advance` and positioning offsets; `FontAtlas.RequestAsync` takes glyphs as well as text.

### Fixed

- A swapchain rebuild that failed - out of device memory, say - left the presenter without surfaces, and the next frame
  drew into them and crashed the process. `GraphicsPresenter.IsReady` now says whether the surfaces exist,
  `GraphicsDevice.BeginDraw` skips the frame while they do not, and the failed rebuild reports `OutOfDate`, so it is
  retried on the next frame. A retry no longer destroys the swapchain objects a second time.
- `ErrorOutOfDeviceMemory` when several applications, or an application and its designer previews, ran at once on a GPU
  without Resizable BAR. The device-local host-visible window (about 214 MB on such cards) is shared by every process;
  when it is full, buffers that want it now take host-visible system memory instead of failing.
- Letters of one height no longer jump a pixel apart within a line. `TextLayout` rounded each glyph's top and bottom to
  a whole pixel on their own, so a round letter, a fraction of a pixel above a flat one, could land a whole pixel above
  it. Only the line's baseline is rounded now; every glyph stands exactly where the font draws it.
- CFF delta arrays (`BlueValues`, `OtherBlues`, `StemSnapH` and the rest) were decoded backwards: each value was taken
  as the difference from the previous one instead of their sum.
- Every base glyph of a mark-to-base subtable got the anchors of the first one, so a mark sat where it belonged on one
  letter only. The GDEF mark glyph sets were read from the wrong offset.
- `Font.GetGlyphByIndex` returned the glyph at that position among the glyphs `cmap` maps, not the glyph with that
  index, so any glyph reached through a substitution - a ligature, a small capital - came back as another one.

### Changed

- `TextLayout` shapes its text with `TextShaper`: the font's ligatures, contextual alternates, mark positioning and
  kerning apply, and a character the font lacks draws its `.notdef` box instead of nothing. A glyph is no longer one
  character: `GetTextData` lists glyphs with the UTF-16 offset of their first character, and caret positions come from
  `GetCaretStops`.
- `IFont.FeatureCatalog` replaces `FeatureService`: the features a font offers per script (`FontScript`) and language
  system (`FontLanguage`), each with its table and parameters, as the font lists them. Before, the features of every
  script were merged by name and the first script's won, so a Serbian or Bulgarian `locl` was lost behind the Latin one.
  The catalog is read-only: which features apply belongs to the text being shaped (`ShapingOptions`), not to the font.
- Memory blocks in a small heap are a 64th of it, at least 4 MB, instead of an 8th: a process takes about half as much of
  the shared window as before (a designer preview 40 MB instead of 80).
- Running out of memory in every type a buffer allows reports the size, the memory type and the heap.
- Every new memory block is logged at the Debug level with its type, heap and the heap's total in blocks.

### Removed

- The feature application `TextShaper` replaced: `GlyphLayoutContainer`, `IGlyphSubstitutions`, `IGlyphPositioning`,
  `GlyphLayoutData`, `GlyphPosition`, `Glyph.Layout`, `IFont.NotDefLayoutData`, `Feature.Apply`, `Feature.IsEnabled`,
  `FeatureService.EnableFeature` / `ApplyFeature`, and the `SubstituteGlyphs` / `PositionGlyph` methods of lookup
  subtables. They applied one feature at a time with the enabled state kept in the font, and had no implementation for
  contextual subtables.
