# Changelog

Notable changes to the Adamantium Engine packages, in the form of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
All packages share one version.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `Win32Interop.LoadImage` and `GetModuleHandle`, with `LoadImageType` and `LoadImageFlags`: an icon loaded from a
  module's resources, such as the application's own.
- `Win32Interop.EnumDisplayMonitors`, `GetMonitorInfo` and `GetWindowPlacement`, with `MONITORINFOEX`,
  `WINDOWPLACEMENT` and `MonitorEnumProc`: the monitors and their work areas, and a window's restored rectangle.

### Fixed

- `ErrorOutOfDeviceMemory` when several applications, or an application and its designer previews, ran at once on a GPU
  without Resizable BAR. The device-local host-visible window (about 214 MB on such cards) is shared by every process;
  when it is full, buffers that want it now take host-visible system memory instead of failing.
- Letters of one height no longer jump a pixel apart within a line. `TextLayout` rounded each glyph's top and bottom to
  a whole pixel on their own, so a round letter, a fraction of a pixel above a flat one, could land a whole pixel above
  it. Only the line's baseline is rounded now; every glyph stands exactly where the font draws it.
- CFF delta arrays (`BlueValues`, `OtherBlues`, `StemSnapH` and the rest) were decoded backwards: each value was taken
  as the difference from the previous one instead of their sum.

### Changed

- Memory blocks in a small heap are a 64th of it, at least 4 MB, instead of an 8th: a process takes about half as much of
  the shared window as before (a designer preview 40 MB instead of 80).
- Running out of memory in every type a buffer allows reports the size, the memory type and the heap.
- Every new memory block is logged at the Debug level with its type, heap and the heap's total in blocks.
