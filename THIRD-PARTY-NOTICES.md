# Third-party notices

Parts of this engine are derived from other people's work. All of it is under the MIT licence, which permits use,
modification and distribution — including inside a closed product — on one condition: the copyright notice and the
licence text travel with the code. The per-file headers in the sources are that notice and must not be removed; this
file carries the licence texts they refer to.

Listed here is code that was *taken in and edited*, not packages consumed as dependencies — those carry their own
licences with them.

**On modifications.** All of this has been changed, some of it heavily. That is what the licence allows, and it does not
transfer anything: the original notice stays with a derived file for as long as any of the original remains in it, and
the changes themselves belong to this project. Both statements are meant to be read together — the header says whose
work it started as, this file says it did not stay that way.

## FJCore — JPEG codec

**Where:** `Adamantium.Imaging/Jpeg/` (22 files: decoder, encoder, DCT, colour models, filters)

A pure C# JPEG codec, originally a Fluxcapacity Open Source project by Jeffrey Powers, later mirrored on GitHub after
Google Code shut down. Upstream is no longer maintained — the last code change was in 2016 — which changes nothing about
the grant: an MIT licence, once given, is not withdrawn by a project going quiet.

Our copy diverged from upstream long ago and keeps diverging: it was reworked to fit this engine's imaging types, and
most recently the inverse DCT was rebuilt for speed and a forced `GC.Collect()` taken out of the decode path. Those
changes are this project's; the notice below covers what they were made to.

Later maintainers of the same codebase state their copyright as
`(c) 2008-2009 Occipital Open Source, (c) 2010-2013 Brian Donahue, (c) 2012-2013 Anders Gustafsson, Cureos AB`,
under the same licence.

**What it supports**, so nobody expects more from it than it has: baseline (SOF0) and progressive (SOF2) JPEG. Not
JPEG 2000 — that is a different format built on wavelets, and there is no code for it here.

## HarfBuzz — Arabic shaper, modified combining classes

**Where:** `Adamantium.Fonts/Shaping/ArabicShaper.cs`, and `GetModifiedCombiningClass` in
`Adamantium.Fonts/Shaping/UnicodeData.cs`

The joining state table, the list of modifier combining marks and the order the Arabic features apply in follow
HarfBuzz's Arabic shaper (`src/hb-ot-shaper-arabic.cc`, https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz); the combining classes
remapped for Hebrew, Arabic, Thai and Tibetan follow its `hb-unicode.hh`. Both are ported to C#. HarfBuzz is under the
"Old MIT" licence:

## SharpDX

**Where:** ten files still carry its notice, and only those ten are derived from it —

- `Adamantium.Imaging`: `ImageDescription.cs`, `PixelBuffer.cs`, `PixelBufferArray.cs`, and DDS handling
  (`DdsHelper.cs`, `DdsFlags.cs`, `FourCC.cs`, `HeaderDXT10.cs`)
- `Adamantium.Core`: `DataBuffer.cs`, `NamedObject.cs`
- `Adamantium.Mathematics`: `ViewportF.cs`

Everything else that once came from it has been rewritten and carries no notice.

**Its own ancestry.** SharpDX did not write its maths either: that part came in from SlimMath, itself a port of the
maths in SlimDX, under MIT/X11. So `ViewportF.cs` — and anything else here descended from that maths — traces back
further than the header says. The terms are the same all the way down, which is why one notice covers the chain; it is
recorded because provenance is worth knowing accurately, not because a second obligation exists.

Maths is also where this project keeps rewriting. As a file stops containing any of the original, its notice stops
applying and can go — but that is judged per file, on what is actually left in it, not on how much work has been done
around it.
